# Pulse-Creative Assessment Test

## Description

This is an assessment test for Pulse-Creative. A Photoshop mockup of a landing page was provided to reproduce in a live WordPress site. The site was created locally using Local by Flywheel and then deployed to a minimal AWS Lightsail server under https://demo.markelliottva.com. The landing page was implemented using a child theme of the Understap theme with a fully custom front-page including JavaScript to create the What We Do section.
